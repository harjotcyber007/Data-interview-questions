If you’re currently employed, why you don’t you like your current job? If you’re not, what are some of the ideal aspects you’re looking for in a data science or data analyst job? What specifically excites you and why do you want to do it?
Out of all of your data analyst projects what was the one you're most proud of and why?
Have you ever found an analysis that was the opposite of what you were hoping for? If not, suppose you performed an analysis where a client was hoping for one outcome, but in fact you got the opposite of what they were hoping it would show? How did you or would you handle this?
You're a consultant. Briefly and concisely describe your approach/process to how you would go about solving this problem: You're given a large corpus of Twitter data. Please predict whether the tweet is a disaster or not.

You're the new and ONLY DS hire for a company that analyzes medical images. The company has 10 million samples. Of the 10 million samples: 3 million are bone fractures for the foot, 2 million are bone fractures for the knee, and 5 million are bone fractures for the shoulder. The company wants to predict the severity of bone fractures in the foot. How would you split your dataset for train, validation, and testing (what % of each)?
